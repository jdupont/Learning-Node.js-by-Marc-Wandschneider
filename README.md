# Learning Node.js

I worked my way through [Learning Node.js](https://www.amazon.com/Learning-Node-js-Hands-Applications-JavaScript/dp/0321910575) by Marc Wandschneider. I highly recommend this excellent book as a starting point for getting up and running with Node.js.

This repository contains all of the code I wrote while following along with the book, including sample code and coding projects.

Most of the code was originally authored by Marc Wandschneider, but I have updated it to use more modern JavaScript constructs (such as using template literals instead of string concatenation). The unaltered source is available on Marc's Github in [this repository](https://github.com/marcwan/LearningNodeJS).
